          <h3>Bulbasaur</h3>
          <p>
            Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin
            with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils and pointed,
            ear-like structures on top of its head. Its snout is short and
            blunt, and it has a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are
            visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick
            legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb,
            which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides
            it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the
            nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
